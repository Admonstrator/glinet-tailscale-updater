| **Dependencies** | `xz` (auto-installed if missing and UPX compression is used)   |

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

Run the updater without cloning the repository:

```bash
wget -O update-tailscale.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/glinet-tailscale-updater/main/update-tailscale.sh && sh update-tailscale.sh
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Do not run this script as a cron job! Manual execution is recommended.


## üéõÔ∏è Arguments

The `update-tailscale.sh` script supports the following arguments:

| Argument              | Description                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--ignore-free-space` | Bypasses the free space check. Use with caution on low-storage devices!                                                          |
| `--force`             | Skips all confirmation prompts and makes installation permanent. Ideal for unattended installations.                             |
| `--force-upgrade`     | Forces upgrade even if the current version is already up to date. Useful for reinstalling the same version.                      |
| `--restore`           | Restores original firmware binaries (`/usr/sbin/tailscaled` and `/usr/sbin/tailscale`). ‚ö†Ô∏è Does not restore config files!         |
| `--no-upx`            | Skips UPX compression. Binaries will be larger but installation is faster.                                                       |
| `--no-download`       | Skips downloading binaries. Use pre-downloaded archive at `/tmp/tailscale.tar.gz`.                                               |
| `--no-tiny`           | Uses full Tailscale binaries instead of tiny version. Not recommended for GL.iNet routers.                                       |
| `--select-release`    | Displays available releases and lets you choose a specific version. ‚ö†Ô∏è Downgrading not officially supported!                      |
| `--testing`           | Uses prerelease/testing versions from the testing branch. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use at your own risk!** May contain bugs or experimental features. |
| `--ssh`               | Enables Tailscale SSH feature after installation.                                                                                |
| `--exit-node`         | Enables exit node support automatically (advertises this router as an exit node).                                                |
| `--log`               | Shows timestamps in all log messages. Useful for debugging and tracking execution time.                                          |
| `--ascii`             | Uses ASCII characters (`[OK]`, `[X]`, `[!]`, `[->]`) instead of emojis for compatibility with older terminals.                   |
| `--help`              | Displays help message with all available arguments.                                                                              |

## üìö Usage Examples

### Testing/Prerelease Versions

Install prerelease versions from the testing branch for early access to new features:

```bash
wget -O update-tailscale.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/glinet-tailscale-updater/main/update-tailscale.sh && sh update-tailscale.sh --testing
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Testing versions are experimental and may contain bugs or unstable features. Use at your own risk!

### Select a Specific Version

Install a specific Tailscale version (useful if the latest version has issues):

```bash
wget -O update-tailscale.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/glinet-tailscale-updater/main/update-tailscale.sh && sh update-tailscale.sh --select-release
```

The script will display available releases for you to choose from.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Downgrading Tailscale is not officially supported and may cause unexpected behavior.

### Force Update (Unattended Installation)

Skip all prompts and make the installation permanent:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --force
```

Combine with `--ignore-free-space` for devices with limited storage:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --force --ignore-free-space
```

### Restore Original Binaries

Revert to the original firmware binaries:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --restore
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Caution:** This does not restore configuration files and may result in a broken installation.

### Logging and Output Options

Enable timestamps for debugging or tracking execution time:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --log
```

Use ASCII characters instead of emojis for compatibility with older terminals:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --ascii
```

Combine both options:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --log --ascii
```

## üîç Key Features Explained

### üéØ OpenWrt/GL.iNet Tailscale Optimizations

The script automatically adds critical flags to the `gl_tailscale` script for proper exit node and subnet routing functionality:

**Flags Added:**
- `--stateful-filtering=false` - Required for exit node compatibility
- `--netfilter-mode=off` - Lets OpenWrt manage firewall rules (prevents conflicts)
- `--snat-subnet-routes=true` - Enables source NAT for proper routing (critical for exit nodes to work)

**Why These Are Important:**
- **netfilter-mode=off**: GL.iNet routers use OpenWrt's firewall management. Letting Tailscale manage iptables/netfilter causes conflicts and routing issues.
- **snat-subnet-routes=true**: Without SNAT, LAN devices behind your GL.iNet router cannot properly respond to Tailscale IP addresses. This is why exit node traffic fails to forward.

These modifications are:
- ‚úÖ Applied automatically during installation
- ‚úÖ Permanent (survive firmware upgrades)
- ‚úÖ Essential for exit node functionality on OpenWrt-based routers

### üîê Tailscale SSH ready

If you agree to enable Tailscale SSH during installation (manually or by using `--ssh`), the script will automatically configure Tailscale SSH after updating. You can read more about Tailscale SSH [here](https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh).

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** If you are connected to your router via Tailscale SSH, you will be disconnected when SSH support is enabled. This might cause the script to terminate prematurely. It is recommended to run the script via local SSH or via GoodCloud SSH terminal.

### üö™ Exit Node Configuration

The script supports two mutually exclusive exit node modes via UCI configuration:

1. **Advertise as Exit Node (Server Mode)**: Your router acts as an exit node, allowing other devices on your Tailnet to route their internet traffic through it.
   - Set: `uci set tailscale.settings.exit_node_enabled=1`
   - Do NOT set `tailscale.settings.exit_node_ip`

2. **Use Exit Node (Client Mode)**: Your router routes its traffic through another exit node on your Tailnet.
   - Set: `uci set tailscale.settings.exit_node_enabled=1`
   - Set: `uci set tailscale.settings.exit_node_ip=<IP_ADDRESS>` (e.g., `100.64.0.1`)

The script automatically ensures these modes are mutually exclusive. When you enable exit node support with `--exit-node`, it defaults to advertising this router as an exit node (server mode). You can later switch to client mode by setting the `exit_node_ip` via UCI and restarting Tailscale with `gl_tailscale restart`.

**Important Notes:**
- **Server Mode**: When advertising as an exit node, `--advertise-routes` is automatically removed to prevent conflicts, as exit nodes should not advertise specific subnet routes.
- **Client Mode**: When using another exit node, `--advertise-routes` is preserved, allowing your local networks to remain accessible via Tailscale while routing internet traffic through the exit node.

### üì¶ Tiny-Tailscale

By default, the script uses optimized tiny binaries that:
- üîπ Significantly reduce storage footprint
- üîπ Maintain full functionality
- üîπ Skip UPX compression (already optimized)
- üîπ Are recommended for all GL.iNet routers

Use `--no-tiny` if you need the full-sized binaries.

### üóúÔ∏è UPX Compression

For standard (non-tiny) binaries, UPX compression:
- üîπ Substantially reduces binary size
- üîπ Is recommended for storage-limited devices
- üîπ Requires `xz` (auto-installed if missing)
- üîπ Can be disabled with `--no-upx`
