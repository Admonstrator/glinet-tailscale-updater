# Tailscale Update Script for GL.iNet Routers

<img src="images/screen.jpg" width="400" align="right" alt="Profile Picture" style="border-radius: 10%;">

This script is designed to update Tailscale on GL.iNet routers.

It was created by [Admon](https://forum.gl-inet.com/u/admon/) for the GL.iNet community and tested on nearly all GL.iNet routers with firmware 4.x. Even the newest model, the [GL.iNet Flint 3](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-be9300/), is supported.

## Requirements

- GL.iNet router with firmware 4.x
- Supported architecture: arm64, armv7, mips
- Free space: at least 15 MB
- xz installed if you want to use UPX compression, if it's not installed, the script will install it for you

## Arguments

The `update-tailscale.sh` script supports the following arguments:

- `--ignore-free-space`: Ignores the free space check. Useful for devices with low free space. Use with caution!

- `--force`: Skips all confirmation prompts and makes the install permanent. Useful for unattended installations. Use with caution!

- `--restore`: Restores the original files (`/usr/sbin/tailscaled` and `/usr/sbin/tailscale`) from the firmware. Does not restore configuration files and may lead to a broken installation. Use with caution!

- `--no-upx`: Skips the UPX compression. The tailscale binaries will be larger but the update will be faster.

- `--no-download`: Skips the download of the tailscale binaries. Useful if you have already downloaded the binaries and want to use them. Store the archive as `/tmp/tailscale.tar.gz`.

- `--no-tiny`: Won't use the tiny version of the tailscale binaries. Useful if you want to use the full version of the tailscale binaries. The tiny version is recommended for GL.iNet routers.

- `--select-release`: Allows you to select a specific release version from the repository. The script will display all available releases and let you choose one. **Note:** Downgrading is not officially supported by Tailscale and could lead to issues.

- `--help`: Displays the help message with information about the available arguments.

## Quick start

You can run it without cloning the repository by using the following command:

```shell
wget -O update-tailscale.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/glinet-tailscale-updater/main/update-tailscale.sh && sh update-tailscale.sh
```

**Please do not run this script as a cron job! It is recommended to run it manually!**

## Selecting a specific version

If you need to install a specific version of Tailscale (for example, if the latest version doesn't work with your modem), you can use the `--select-release` option:

```shell
wget -O update-tailscale.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/glinet-tailscale-updater/main/update-tailscale.sh && sh update-tailscale.sh --select-release
```

The script will display a list of available releases and allow you to select one by entering its corresponding number. **Important:** Downgrading Tailscale is not officially supported and may lead to unexpected behavior or issues.

## Force update

By using the --force option, the script will skip all confirmation prompts. It will make the install permanent. This is useful for unattended installations. In combination with --ignore-free-space, it will also skip the free space check. Please use with caution!

## Running on devices with low free space

You can use --ignore-free-space to ignore the free space check. This is useful for devices with low free space. Please use with caution!

## Tailscale stateful filtering

The script will add the `--stateful-filtering=false` option to the gl_tailscale script. This is necessary for the tailscaled service to work correctly on GL.iNet routers, if exit nodes are used. The modification is done automatically and you don't have to do anything. It will be permanent and will survive a firmware upgrade.

## Tiny-Tailscale

By default, the script will use the tiny version of the tailscale binaries. They are way smaller and will save plenty of space on your device. If you want to use the full version of the tailscale binaries, you can use the `--no-tiny` option. There are no other differences between the tiny and the full version of the tailscale binaries. UPX compression will be skipped while using the tiny version.

## UPX compression

The script uses UPX to compress the tailscale binaries. You will be asked if you want to use UPX compression. It is recommended to use UPX compression, as it will reduce the size of the tailscale binaries. If you choose not to use UPX compression, the script will still work, but the tailscale binaries will be larger. UPX compression will be skipped while using the tiny version of the tailscale binaries.

## Restoring the original files

You can use `--restore` to restore the original files. This will replace the `/usr/sbin/tailscaled` and `/usr/sbin/tailscale` files with the original files coming from the firmware. It will not restore your configuration files and might lead to a broken installation. Please use with caution!
