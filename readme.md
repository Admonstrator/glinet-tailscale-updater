---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run the updater without cloning the repository:

```bash
wget -O update-tailscale.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/glinet-tailscale-updater/main/update-tailscale.sh && sh update-tailscale.sh
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Do not run this script as a cron job! Manual execution is recommended.


## 🎛️ Arguments

The `update-tailscale.sh` script supports the following arguments:

| Argument              | Description                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--ignore-free-space` | Bypasses the free space check. Use with caution on low-storage devices!                                                          |
| `--force`             | Skips all confirmation prompts and makes installation permanent. Ideal for unattended installations.                             |
| `--force-upgrade`     | Forces upgrade even if the current version is already up to date. Useful for reinstalling the same version.                      |
| `--restore`           | Restores original firmware binaries (`/usr/sbin/tailscaled` and `/usr/sbin/tailscale`). ⚠️ Does not restore config files!         |
| `--no-upx`            | Skips UPX compression. Binaries will be larger but installation is faster.                                                       |
| `--no-download`       | Skips downloading binaries. Use pre-downloaded archive at `/tmp/tailscale.tar.gz`.                                               |
| `--no-tiny`           | Uses full Tailscale binaries instead of tiny version. Not recommended for GL.iNet routers.                                       |
| `--select-release`    | Displays available releases and lets you choose a specific version. ⚠️ Downgrading not officially supported!                      |
| `--background`        | Runs script in background mode, survives SSH disconnection. Logs to `/tmp/tailscale-update.log`. Recommended when using `--ssh`! |
| `--testing`           | Uses prerelease/testing versions from the testing branch. ⚠️ **Use at your own risk!** May contain bugs or experimental features. |
| `--ssh`               | Enables Tailscale SSH feature after installation.                                                                                |
| `--log`               | Shows timestamps in all log messages. Useful for debugging and tracking execution time.                                          |
| `--ascii`             | Uses ASCII characters (`[OK]`, `[X]`, `[!]`, `[->]`) instead of emojis for compatibility with older terminals.                   |
| `--help`              | Displays help message with all available arguments.                                                                              |

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Background Mode (Recommended for SSH over Tailscale)

Run the script in background mode to prevent interruption when Tailscale restarts:

```bash
wget -O update-tailscale.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/glinet-tailscale-updater/main/update-tailscale.sh && sh update-tailscale.sh --background --force
```

This is especially useful when:
- Connected via Tailscale SSH (prevents session termination)
- Running over an unstable connection
- Enabling Tailscale SSH with `--ssh` flag

Monitor the background execution:

```bash
tail -f /tmp/tailscale-update.log
```

> **💡 Tip:** The script automatically saves your preferences and continues running even if SSH disconnects!

### Testing/Prerelease Versions

Install prerelease versions from the testing branch for early access to new features:

```bash
wget -O update-tailscale.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/glinet-tailscale-updater/main/update-tailscale.sh && sh update-tailscale.sh --testing
```

> **⚠️ Warning:** Testing versions are experimental and may contain bugs or unstable features. Use at your own risk!

### Select a Specific Version

Install a specific Tailscale version (useful if the latest version has issues):

```bash
wget -O update-tailscale.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/glinet-tailscale-updater/main/update-tailscale.sh && sh update-tailscale.sh --select-release
```

The script will display available releases for you to choose from.

> **⚠️ Warning:** Downgrading Tailscale is not officially supported and may cause unexpected behavior.

### Force Update (Unattended Installation)

Skip all prompts and make the installation permanent:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --force
```

Combine with `--ignore-free-space` for devices with limited storage:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --force --ignore-free-space
```

### Restore Original Binaries

Revert to the original firmware binaries:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --restore
```

> **⚠️ Caution:** This does not restore configuration files and may result in a broken installation.

### Logging and Output Options

Enable timestamps for debugging or tracking execution time:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --log
```

Use ASCII characters instead of emojis for compatibility with older terminals:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --ascii
```

Combine both options:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --log --ascii
```

## 🔍 Key Features Explained

### 🎯 Tailscale Stateful Filtering

The script automatically adds `--stateful-filtering=false` to the `gl_tailscale` script. This is required for proper exit node functionality on GL.iNet routers. The modification is:
- ✅ Applied automatically
- ✅ Permanent (survives firmware upgrades)
- ✅ No manual configuration needed

### 🔐 Tailscale SSH ready

If you agree to enable Tailscale SSH during installation (manually or by using `--ssh`), the script will automatically configure Tailscale SSH after updating. You can read more about Tailscale SSH [here](https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh).

**⚠️ Warning:** If you are connected to your router via Tailscale SSH, you will be disconnected when SSH support is enabled. This might cause the script to terminate prematurely.

**💡 Solution:** Use the `--background` flag to run the script in background mode, which will continue execution even if your SSH session disconnects:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --background --ssh --force
```

Alternatively, run the script via local SSH or via GoodCloud SSH terminal.

### 📦 Tiny-Tailscale

By default, the script uses optimized tiny binaries that:
- 🔹 Significantly reduce storage footprint
- 🔹 Maintain full functionality
- 🔹 Skip UPX compression (already optimized)
- 🔹 Are recommended for all GL.iNet routers

Use `--no-tiny` if you need the full-sized binaries.

### 🗜️ UPX Compression

For standard (non-tiny) binaries, UPX compression:
- 🔹 Substantially reduces binary size
- 🔹 Is recommended for storage-limited devices
- 🔹 Requires `xz` (auto-installed if missing)
- 🔹 Can be disabled with `--no-upx`
