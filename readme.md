## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Automatic Updates** - Fetches and installs the latest Tailscale version
- 📦 **Tiny Version Support** - Uses optimized tiny binaries to save space
- 🗜️ **UPX Compression** - Further reduces binary size when needed
- 🎯 **Version Selection** - Install specific Tailscale versions
- 🔧 **Stateful Filtering** - Auto-configures for exit node compatibility
- 🛡️ **Safe Restore** - Restore original firmware binaries if needed
- ⚡ **Flexible Options** - Multiple flags for customized installations

---

## 📋 Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Router** | GL.iNet router with firmware 4.x (including GL-BE9300 Flint 3) |
| **Architecture** | arm64, armv7, mips, mipsle, or x86_64 |
| **Free Space** | At least 15 MB (can be bypassed with `--ignore-free-space`) |
| **Dependencies** | `xz` (auto-installed if missing and UPX compression is used) |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run the updater without cloning the repository:

```bash
wget -O update-tailscale.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/glinet-tailscale-updater/main/update-tailscale.sh && sh update-tailscale.sh
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Do not run this script as a cron job! Manual execution is recommended.


## 🎛️ Arguments

The `update-tailscale.sh` script supports the following arguments:

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--ignore-free-space` | Bypasses the free space check. Use with caution on low-storage devices! |
| `--force` | Skips all confirmation prompts and makes installation permanent. Ideal for unattended installations. |
| `--force-upgrade` | Forces upgrade even if the current version is already up to date. Useful for reinstalling the same version. |
| `--restore` | Restores original firmware binaries (`/usr/sbin/tailscaled` and `/usr/sbin/tailscale`). ⚠️ Does not restore config files! |
| `--no-upx` | Skips UPX compression. Binaries will be larger but installation is faster. |
| `--no-download` | Skips downloading binaries. Use pre-downloaded archive at `/tmp/tailscale.tar.gz`. |
| `--no-tiny` | Uses full Tailscale binaries instead of tiny version. Not recommended for GL.iNet routers. |
| `--select-release` | Displays available releases and lets you choose a specific version. ⚠️ Downgrading not officially supported! |
| `--testing` | Uses prerelease/testing versions from the testing branch. ⚠️ **Use at your own risk!** May contain bugs or experimental features. |
| `--log` | Shows timestamps in all log messages. Useful for debugging and tracking execution time. |
| `--ascii` | Uses ASCII characters (`[OK]`, `[X]`, `[!]`, `[->]`) instead of emojis for compatibility with older terminals. |
| `--help` | Displays help message with all available arguments. |

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Testing/Prerelease Versions

Install prerelease versions from the testing branch for early access to new features:

```bash
wget -O update-tailscale.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/glinet-tailscale-updater/main/update-tailscale.sh && sh update-tailscale.sh --testing
```

> **⚠️ Warning:** Testing versions are experimental and may contain bugs or unstable features. Use at your own risk!

### Select a Specific Version

Install a specific Tailscale version (useful if the latest version has issues):

```bash
wget -O update-tailscale.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/glinet-tailscale-updater/main/update-tailscale.sh && sh update-tailscale.sh --select-release
```

The script will display available releases for you to choose from.

> **⚠️ Warning:** Downgrading Tailscale is not officially supported and may cause unexpected behavior.

### Force Update (Unattended Installation)

Skip all prompts and make the installation permanent:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --force
```

Combine with `--ignore-free-space` for devices with limited storage:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --force --ignore-free-space
```

### Restore Original Binaries

Revert to the original firmware binaries:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --restore
```

> **⚠️ Caution:** This does not restore configuration files and may result in a broken installation.

### Logging and Output Options

Enable timestamps for debugging or tracking execution time:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --log
```

Use ASCII characters instead of emojis for compatibility with older terminals:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --ascii
```

Combine both options:

```bash
sh update-tailscale.sh --log --ascii
```

## 🔍 Key Features Explained

### 🎯 Tailscale Stateful Filtering

The script automatically adds `--stateful-filtering=false` to the `gl_tailscale` script. This is required for proper exit node functionality on GL.iNet routers. The modification is:
- ✅ Applied automatically
- ✅ Permanent (survives firmware upgrades)
- ✅ No manual configuration needed

### 📦 Tiny-Tailscale

By default, the script uses optimized tiny binaries that:
- 🔹 Significantly reduce storage footprint
- 🔹 Maintain full functionality
- 🔹 Skip UPX compression (already optimized)
- 🔹 Are recommended for all GL.iNet routers

Use `--no-tiny` if you need the full-sized binaries.

### 🗜️ UPX Compression

For standard (non-tiny) binaries, UPX compression:
- 🔹 Substantially reduces binary size
- 🔹 Is recommended for storage-limited devices
- 🔹 Requires `xz` (auto-installed if missing)
- 🔹 Can be disabled with `--no-upx`
